Projects from Computational Linguistics Course (ling492b)

Wrote python script to:

<p>Lab 1: filter and analyze corpus of twitter data to calculate relative frequency of words and most frequently used words</p>
Lab 2: train and implement morphological analogy model to generate endings for made-up verbs (modelling experimental data from Albright & Hayes (2003))
Lab 3: use n-gram (bi-gram and tri-gram) model to analyze and generate words following English phonotactics
Lab 4: implement the Forward Procedure and the Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models to calculate probability of a sequence of words and the most probably POS tag
Lab 5: utilize context-free grammar to describe grammar rules and produce natural sentences
Lab 6: used probalistic cky parsing algorithm to generate parses for small corpus of sentences
