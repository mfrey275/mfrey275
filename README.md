Projects from Computational Linguistics Course (ling492b)

Wrote python script to:

<p>Lab 1: filter and analyze corpus of twitter data to calculate relative frequency of words and most frequently used words</p>
<p>Lab 2: train and implement morphological analogy model to generate endings for made-up verbs (modelling experimental data from Albright & Hayes (2003))</p>
<p>Lab 3: use n-gram (bi-gram and tri-gram) model to analyze and generate words following English phonotactics</p>
<p>Lab 4: implement the Forward Procedure and the Viterbi Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models to calculate probability of a sequence of words and the most probably POS tag</p>
<p>Lab 5: utilize context-free grammar to describe grammar rules and produce natural sentences</p>
<p>Lab 6: used probalistic cky parsing algorithm to generate parses for small corpus of sentences</p>
